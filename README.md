# Assignment-5
This repository contains the solutions for **Task 1** and **Task 2** of the Assignment-5.

## Files in this repository
- **Assignment4_task1.py** – Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt, prints its content line by line & handles errors gracefully if the file doesn't exist.
- **Assignment4_task2.py** – Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt, appends any additional data to the same file & reads and displays the final content of the file.

## Description

These programs demonstrate basic Python concepts such as:
- **Variables**
- **Input and Output**
- **Conditional statements**
- **File Handling and modes**
- **Exception Handling**
  
Each script follows the assignment instructions and produces the required output.
